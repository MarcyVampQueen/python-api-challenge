3 Observable Trends
-------------------
1) As expected, the max temperature is higher in cities closer to the equator.

2) Wind Speed seems to be uncorrelated to location, but locations farther into the north have much higher wind speed in general, possibly due to cold winds moving in.

3) Humidity is a bit all over the place, but near the equator tends to be higher.
